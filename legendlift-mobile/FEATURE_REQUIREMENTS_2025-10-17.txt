LEGENDLIFT APP - FEATURE REQUIREMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Date: October 17, 2025
Status: Pending Implementation
================================================================================

================================================================================
SECTION 1: CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

1.1 ADD NEW CUSTOMER FORM - ADDITIONAL FIELDS
----------------------------------------------
Current State: Basic customer fields exist (name, job_number, area, phone)

NEW FIELDS TO ADD:
✓ Customer name (exists)
✓ Site name (exists as "name")
✓ Job number (exists)
✓ Area (exists)
✓ Contact number (exists as "phone")

NEW REQUIRED FIELDS:
❌ AMC valid period FROM date (Date picker)
❌ AMC valid period TO date (Date picker)
❌ No of services per year (Dropdown: 6, 9, 10, 12)
❌ AMC amount (Decimal - total contract amount)
❌ AMC amount received (Decimal - partial payment tracking)
❌ AMC amount balance (Auto-calculated: total - received)
❌ AMC status (Enum: Active/Inactive/Expiring Soon)
❌ Type of door (Dropdown: Automatic, Manual, Semi-automatic)
❌ Type of controller (Text input)
❌ Number of floors (Integer input)
❌ Building type (Dropdown: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mixed)
❌ Lift capacity (String: e.g., "8 persons" or "630 kg")
❌ Installation date (Date picker - optional)
❌ Warranty expiry date (Date picker - optional)

VALIDATION RULES:
- AMC TO date must be > AMC FROM date
- AMC amount received cannot exceed AMC amount
- No of services per year: only allow 6, 9, 10, 12
- Admin sets initial AMC status manually


1.2 AMC STATUS AUTO-MANAGEMENT
-------------------------------
BUSINESS RULES:
1. Admin creates customer with AMC status = "Active" (manual)
2. System runs daily check (cron job/scheduled task):
   - If current_date > amc_valid_to + 30 days → Set status = "Inactive"
   - If current_date > amc_valid_to AND current_date <= amc_valid_to + 30 days → Set status = "Expiring Soon"
   - If current_date >= amc_valid_from AND current_date <= amc_valid_to → Keep status = "Active"

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Backend cron job: runs daily at 00:01 AM
- Update all customers' AMC status based on dates
- Log status changes
- Optional: Send notification to admin for expiring AMCs


1.3 AUTO SERVICE SCHEDULE CREATION
-----------------------------------
TRIGGER: When admin creates/updates customer with AMC details

LOGIC:
1. Calculate service interval:
   - 12 services/year = every 30 days (365/12)
   - 10 services/year = every 36 days (365/10)
   - 9 services/year = every 40 days (365/9)
   - 6 services/year = every 60 days (365/6)

2. Generate services:
   - First service date = AMC valid FROM date
   - Subsequent services = previous_date + interval
   - Continue until date <= AMC valid TO date

3. Service details:
   - service_type = "SERVICE" (AMC service)
   - status = "PENDING"
   - customer_id = customer ID
   - scheduled_date = calculated date
   - is_adhoc = False
   - contract_id = AMC contract reference

EXAMPLE:
AMC FROM: 2025-01-01
AMC TO: 2025-12-31
Services per year: 12
Generated services: 1st of each month (Jan 1, Feb 1, Mar 1, etc.)

================================================================================
SECTION 10: NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Auto service generation: Use background job for large batches
- Notification sending: Queue system for bulk notifications
- Service list: Paginate if > 100 services
- Callback reminders: Batch process every hour

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Technicians cannot create callbacks/repairs (admin only)
- Technicians can only view their assigned services/callbacks/repairs
- Admin cannot join services (view only)
- Validate customer AMC status before callback creation

UI/UX CONSIDERATIONS:
- Clear visual distinction between Service/Callback/Repair tabs
- Prominent color coding for priorities
- Easy access to "Create Callback/Repair" for admin
- Push notification with sound for callbacks
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions

DATA MIGRATION:
- Existing customers: Set default AMC status = 'Inactive'
- Existing services: Set service_type = 'SERVICE'
- Existing services: Set max_technicians = 3
